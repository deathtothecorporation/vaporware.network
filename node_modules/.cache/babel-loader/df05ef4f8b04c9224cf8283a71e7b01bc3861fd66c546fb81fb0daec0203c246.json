The promise is identical: decentralized, unstoppable, and permissionless use and composability. The market views NFTs as cultural artifacts like art, or as generalized property rights like a deed or right to access some good. dApps are understood as autonomous protocols running on the blockchain; software that is accessible to anyone, anywhere, anytime. In reality, none of that is true. Not because blockchains don’t work, but because there are layers of additional technology that are needed to access and use them. Vapor is a project that’s designed to free us from these last points of centralized control, allowing us to build and sell the kinds of rich decentralized apps that we’ve been talking about for years. We are still in the Mt. Gox era of NFTs and dApps. To make or buy an NFT, to use a dApp we have no choice but to confer absolute trust to a small number of organizations that have the technical capacity required to make these tools usable for us. Comparing it to a world where DeFi, decentralized finance, had never been invented, would be understating the problem. It’s more similar to a world where holding your own keys, controlling your own coins, isn’t even possible. Where are these points of centralization? Anytime you connect your wallet to a website, you are relying on centralized software. MetaMask displays your NFTs by requesting a copy of that data from OpenSea, not the blockchain. When you mint or buy an artwork, you aren’t talking to Ethereum: you’re submitting a form to Consensys or to Alchemy; two companies that run ETH nodes so that you don’t have to. Your NFT artwork – unless it’s small enough to live on-chain, which almost none of them are – is hosted somewhere else. More than 40% of NFT artwork just lives directly on a company owned server – opensea.com/your_nft – just waiting for the sweet oblivion of bankruptcy. If the marketplace is more clever, they’ll use a storage network like IPFS. IPFS looks like a decentralized protocol, but it’s not. To store something on IPFS, you need to run a piece of software on a server. Since running a server is a god damn nightmare, NFT marketplaces have completely outsourced this job to a handful of large companies. Marketplaces pay to keep your files hosted. If the marketplace or the host goes out of business, you better have a list of the content IDs and files to find a back up option, because they aren’t going to help you. This isn’t just a philosophical point: our software is held back by these problems. There are entire categories of tools that we can’t build because of these design constraints. Anyone that has minted an NFT knows how ridiculous the limitations are: most marketplaces cap you at 100-200MB, limit you to a handful of file types, and can’t support any dynamic or interactive experiences, let alone rich software or gaming experiences. The risk of getting rugged, even by an honest and well-meaning development team, has undermined the ability for this industry to grow. Institutional investors won’t touch it. Finally, developers and their teams are baring an enormous amount of cost building for these systems. Rather than freeing us from the mud ball of web 2.0 spaghetti code, we’ve tacked on a whole new set of services and frameworks and APIs.
