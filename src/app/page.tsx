            Vaporware is a new kind of internet computer, called a ship. Ships are built on a novel virtual machine, called a <a href="https://media.urbit.org/whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank">solid-state interpreter</a>. 
          </p>

          <p>
Ships combine the functionality of wallets, large file storage, encrypted p2p networking, and full stack web applications into a single framework. They are designed to run in the cloud, but are owned cryptographically by people. Ships are digital appliances.

          <header className="flex flex-row space-between items-center">
            <div className="horizontal-bars shrink mr-4"></div>
            <h1 className="grow whitespace-nowrap">The system</h1>
            <div className="horizontal-bars shrink ml-4"></div>
          </header>

          <p>
            The Vaporware ship is composed of three closely related systems:
            <ul>
              <li>
                a purely functional virtual machine 
              </li>
              <li>
                a tokenized application and package registry 
              </li>
              <li>
                an app store and package management program
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Vaporware is developed as <em>Free and Open Source Software</em> and respects the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html" target="_blank">four essential freedoms</a>.
          </p>

            <div className="horizontal-bars shrink mr-4"></div>
            <h1 className="grow whitespace-nowrap">The device</h1>
            <div className="horizontal-bars shrink ml-4"></div>
          </header>

          <p>
            Like the EVM, the virtual machine used by Vaporware has been designed as infrastructure for a decentralized internet. It is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030524195418id_/http://courses.cs.vt.edu:80/~cs5314/Spring00/LanguagePresentations/Papers/slotta-hudak_extract.pdf" target="_blank">purely functional system</a> and is ultra-minimal. Unlike the EVM, it supports fast parallel computation and can store large amounts of data, cheaply. It does not provide global consensus.
          </p>

          <p>
            Vaporware uses the VM to replace developer-hosted web services with <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08168.pdf" target="_blank">non-custodial web apps</a> &mdash; web apps owned by users.

            <div className="horizontal-bars shrink mr-4"></div>
            <h1 className="grow whitespace-nowrap">The registry</h1>
            <div className="horizontal-bars shrink ml-4"></div>
          </header>

          <p>
            Every ship has a unique identity. NFTs can be registered with the protocol and used as a network handle. Ships encrypt and sign all of their messages by default. The owner of a ship can register the shipâ€™s content onchain and share it with others. Identities are used to control access to registered content.
          </p>

          <p>
            Vaporware is an alternative for <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14927.pdf" target="_blank">decentralized file storage</a>, but can also be used to distribute <em>and run</em> full stack software applications. Registration binds content to an NFT, so users can trustlessly monetize their data and apps.

          <header>
            <div className="horizontal-bars shrink mr-4"></div>
            <h1 className="grow whitespace-nowrap">The app store</h1>
            <div className="horizontal-bars shrink ml-4"></div>
          </header>

          <p>
            The app store is the <em>economic bootloader</em> for the Vaporware network. It is the default program, owned by every user, providing access to purchasable content and software.
          </p>

          <p>
Rather than relying on a central company (like Apple or Steam) to host and monetize apps, users are able to self-host their own access point to a purely p2p, onchain, content distribution market. NFTs provide uncensorable payment rails and the app store provides uncensorable distribution.
